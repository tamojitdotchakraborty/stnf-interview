# To the panel of reviewers
Hello All,

First of all I apologize for the delay. As a matter of fact I was onsite to attend PI planning sessions and lead the planning for the upcoming commitments. I came back last Saturday evening and started to write 
the Terraform modules containing ECS and Fargate , which were not available as a part of my personal
Repo , I conveyed the same to Marina and thank you for considering my situation.
